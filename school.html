<p>i began this server, and set up this website with the intent of giving a fun and social thing to do while you were finished with your school work at school, or when you're bored at home.
If this is being used in a way that damages the users acedemically, or causes any issues with you, please get in contact with me, I am willing to co-operate.</p>
