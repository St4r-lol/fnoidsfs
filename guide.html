        <h1>Server hosting guide</h1>
        <p>This guide will guide you through making you're own self hosted EaglercraftX server, this will be the same way I host my server, there is other ways you can also host it but this is the way I personally suggest.
            <br>Please make sure you read every single instruction, unless instructed to not, to make sure this guide will be helpful and not fail or lead to a lost system.
        </p>
        <p>Quick note, I am not responsible for any lost files or broken hardware.</p>
        <h3>To start off here is everything you will need to follow this guide:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A spare computer with atleast 32 Gigabytes of empty storage, 4 Gigabytes of ram, and a decent CPU. <strong>For this guide we will be calling this computer, the server computer.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>I very much suggest that you use a different computer from the one you mainly use, as we want to make sure it has enough resources to run the server, and also not mess with your current setup. If you have any spare laptops or random old pcs just use one of those.</li>
                    <li>In this guide we will be installing Ubuntu Linux Server onto this computer, so as with any new OS installation there is always a chance of losing any files on the computer already so please <strong>BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT DATA ON THE SERVER COMPUTER BEFORE FOLLOWING THIS GUIDE!!</strong></li>
                    <li>I'm not entirely sure how well it would perform but you <em>could</em> use a raspberry Pi, I would not use a SD card as its main storage, and instead use a M.2 SSD; As the SD card slow disk speeds, will be a HUGE bottleneck that will slow down your server. You also have to know that some instructsions will be different, and as I don't have a raspberry pi to test it on, they will not be included in this guide.</li>
                    <li>You cannot use your school issued chromebook for this</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A USB Flash drive with 4 Gigabytes of storage, or a SD Card with 4 Gigabytes of storage and an SD Card to USB adapater, or if the server computer has a dvd drive: a blank DVD that you can write to.</li>
            <li>A Computer running Windows, Mac*, or Linux, or an android device. <strong>For this guide we will be calling this the &quot;Main computer&quot;</strong>
                <ul><li>*: You can use a computer running mac, but as I don't have a mac computer to test this with, there are no instructions for that.</li><li>You cannot use your school issued chromebook for this either.</li></ul></li>
            <li>
                <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> A second level domain (like the underlined part in <u>google</u>.com, <u>minecraft</u>.net, or <u>wikipedia</u>.org)
                <ul>
                    <li>Needed if you want to use tunneling and use more than 1 Gigabytes a month, host a client, have a dynmap, or have a website along side you server.</li>
                    <li>CANNOT be a subdomain</li>
                    <li>I'd suggest going to <a class="external" href="https://www.namecheap.com/market/buynow/?filter=W3siaWQiOiJwcmljZSIsInZhbHVlIjpbMCw1XX1d">namecheap.com/market/</a>, and entering every single one into your chromebook until you find one thats not blocked.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OPTIONAL</strong> A subdomain that lets you make A records
                <ul>
                    <li>To use this methord you are REQUIRED to port forward, so it doesn't use tunneling.</li>
                    <li>Can also be a second level domain</li>
                    <li>I'd suggesting getting a free one from <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/" class="external">freedns.afraid.org</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="txtLeft">
            <p>An example of a workable setup, Here for this guides server computer I'll be using a 10 year old sony vaio laptop, my dad used to use it for work but he gave it to me because it was just sitting around unused.
                <br>This laptop has a Intel Core i7-4500U CPU @ 1.80GHz, and 8 Gigabytes of ram.
                <br>Right beside it is a SD Card to USB adapter, that will be using a micro SD card to SD card adapter.

        <h2 id="pt1">Part 1: Setting up the server computer OS</h2>
        <p>Personally for all server applications, I will always suggest using Linux to host them, as most server applications don't need a desktop, and operating systems like Windows or Mac waste resources on that and other things that will go unused.
            <br>For this guide we will be using Ubuntu Linux Server</p>
        <h3 id="pt1sec1">Section 1: Downloading Linux</h3>
        <p>Unless said in the step, these steps will be done on the Main Computer</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <a class="external" href="https://ubuntu.com/download/server">ubuntu.com/download/server</a>, if your server computer has a 64-bit CPU, click &quot;Download 24.04.1 LTS&quot;.
                <ul>
                    <li>You can find if your cpu supports 64-bit CPU multiple ways.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the server computer already has an OS installed, you can look it up there. 
                                <br>In windows if you open control panel, go to System and Security > System, and infront &quot;System Type&quot; it should say if it supports 64-bit, if not what cpu architecture it uses.
                                <br>In linux there's usually a &quot;About this System&quot; tab in the settings app, or a CPU app that will tell you if it supports 64-bit, if not what cpu architecture it uses.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you're using a laptop, raspberry pi or pre-made desktop, you can search up it's model number, and you can find if it supports 64-bit, if not what cpu architecture it uses.</li>
                            <li>If you know what CPU is inside the computer you can search it up on google, like if the CPU inside your server computer was a Intel Core i7-4500U, you could search &quot;Intel Core i7-4500 64 bit or 32 bit&quot;, and it would say if it supports 64-bit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>If the CPU in the server computer is not 64-bit or 32-bit, then you can click &quot;Alternative architectures&quot;, where other downloads will be avaliable.</li>
                    <li>If the CPU in the server computer is 32-bit, then you can try using debian as a server from <a class="external" href="https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#mirrors">debian.org</a>, I think it might support a non graphical install but I've never messed with it before so I don't know. The instructions on this guide will be similar but I'm sure mainly in the install programs part, it will be a little different.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Insert the USB Flash drive,SD Card to USB adapter, or DVD into the main computer.</li>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/" class="external">etcher.balena.io</a>, and download the software for whatever OS your main computer uses.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you're using a DVD, you do not need this software, you can just burn the iso to the dvd</li>
                    <li>If you're using a android device, you can use the app ISO 2 USB</li></ul>
            </li>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>To install Ubuntu Server alongside whatever OS is still on the Server Computer, you will have to shrink the partition that houses that OS</p>
                    <h3>If the OS already installed is Windows:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turn on the Server Computer, and log into your windows account.</li>
                        <li>Open up &quot;Disk Management&quot; with admin. At the bottom in &quot;Disk 0&quot; right click the &quot;(C:)&quot; drive, and select &quot;Shrink Volume&quot;</li>
                        <li>In the &quot;Enter the amount of space to srhink in MB, enter at the minimum &quot;32768&quot;, but if you want more storage for the server part, you can shrink it more.</li>
                        <li>Click &quot;Shrink&quot; button.</li>
                        <li>Right click the new &quot;Unallocated&quot; volume</li>

                        <li>Click next next until it asks to &quot;Assign Drive Letter or Path&quot; where you will check &quot;Do not assign a drive letter or drive path&quot; and select next.</li>
                        <li>Set the file system to Fat32 or exfat, then click next and finish</li>
                        <li>Close the app and continue the guide.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>If the OS already installed is Mac or Linux or the Windows solution didn't work:</h3>
                    <p>I'm not confident that this is the simplest solution, but if anyone knows a better way, please let me know.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go to <a class="external" href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">ubuntu.com/download/desktop</a> and select Download</li>

                        <li>Once it finishes, close the software and take the USB Flash drive, or SD Card to USB adapter out of the main computer.</li>
                        <li>Insert the USB Flash drive, SD Card to USB adapter or DVD into the Server Computer.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Turn off the server computer</li>
            <li>Insert the USB Flash drive, SD Card to USB adapter or DVD into the Server Computer.</li>
            <li>Turn on the Server computer, and open the One time boot menu or bios
                <ul>
                    <li>Usually you have to hold a key while the computer is turning on to get into this menu, to find this key, search up &quot;how to open one time boot menu on computer brand name/computer motherboard brand computers/motherboard&quot;, with the &quot;computer brand name/computer motherboard brand computers/motherboard&quot; replaced with whatever brand motherboard your Desktop has or whatever brand your laptop or prebuilt pc is.
                        <br>or replace &quot;one time boot menu&quot; with bios, if your computer doesn't have a one time boot menu</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you opened the One time boot menu, select the USB Flash drive, SD Card to USB adapter or DVD, if you opened the BIOS, you'll likely have to change the boot order, put the USB Flash drive, SD Card to USB adapter or DVD at the first spot, and then apply and restart. If done correctly it should open GNU GRUB</li>
            <li>In the menu choose &quot;Try or install Ubuntu", it will probably flash a bunch of text on the screen, that is normal. Just let it do its thing and wait.</li>
            <li>After a bit it should bring up the installer menus, just go through it, Choose your language, Choose your keyboard layout, Make sure Ubuntu Server is checked (NOT Ubuntu server (minimized), that can cause issues)</li>

        <h3 id="pt1sec3">Section 3: Installing Software & Setting up</h3>
        <p>In this section we will go over setting up and installing all the software required to host the minecraft server. Along with being able to remotely access the server from your Computer or Android device.

        <h3 id="pt2sec5">Section 5: Setting up others being able to join your server.</h3>
        <p>Now that we have actually created the server, we need to make it so people using different internet can connect to your server. There are three methods I suggest.</p>
        <button id="sec8Method1" type="button" class="collapsible largeButton">Method 1 Tunneling using Cloudflare</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The first method I suggest is tunneling with cloudflare. I suggest tunneling through cloudflare over the other options because</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It's tunneled so it doesn't leak your IP Address.</li>
                <li>You can use any domain you have, so if you have a domain thats not blocked you can use it.</li>
                <li>It allows you to create subdomains for your domain that let you tunnel other things like a EaglercraftX client, dynmap, or even a website.</li>
                <li>All this for the low price of you needing to own your own domain, and thats it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cloudflare guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by going to the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" class="external">cloudflare website</a> and creating an account.</li>
                <li>Once you've created an account, you'll want to go to your cloudflare dashboard and opent eh &quot;Websites&quot; tab.</li>
                <li>Input your domain name in the textbox</li>
                <li>Scroll to the bottom and select &quot;Free&quot;, then continue.</li>
                <li>Follow the instructions in the page, including <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/#disable-dnssec" class="external">disabling DNSSEC on your domain</a> and adding the cloudflare name servers
                    <ul>
                        <li>On namecheap to add your cloudflare name servers, go to your namecheap dashboard.</li>
                        <li>Click &quot;Manage&quot; on your purchased domain.</li>
                        <li>Under &quot;NAMESERVERS&quot; set it to &quot;Custom DNS&quot; and add both assigned cloudflare name servers that you were given in the cloudflare page.</li>
                        <li>Run the command below on the server computer, you can use SSH to do this.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Once the name servers are added, click &quot;Check nameservers now&quot; and wait for the email saying that your domain was accepted.</li>
                <li>Once it finnally says your nameservers were accepted, go to the &quot;Zero trust&quot; tab on cloudflare and set that up for your cloudflare account.</li>
                <li>On the Zero Trust dash board, go to the &quot;Networks&quot; tab, and select &quot;Create a tunnel&quot;</li>
                <li>Select &quot;Cloudflared&quot; and hit next.</li>
                <li>Name the tunnel some descriptive thing for your server computer, and hit Save tunnel.</li>
                <li>Set the operating system to Debian, and the architecture to whatever architecture your server computer is, it is likely 64-bit.</li>
                <li>Once you run the command switch to the &quot;Public Hostname&quot; tab, and select &quot;Add a punlic hostname&quot;</li>
                <li>Set the domain to the domain you added before, and i'd suggest setting the subdomain to something like &quot;eag&quot; or &quot;ser&quot;</li>
                <li>Set the type to HTTP, and the URL to &quot;localhost:8081&quot;</li>
                <li>Select Save hostname.</li>
                <li>Back on the server computer start the cloudflared systemd service.
                    <textarea>sudo systemctl start cloudflared</textarea>
                    <ul><li>If it doesn't let you exit, and says something like &quot;lines 1-20&quot; just hit the q key.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you want you can make this auto start by enabling the cloudflared systemd service.
                    <textarea>sudo systemctl enable cloudflared</textarea>
                </li>
                <li>Open up eaglercraft and join the server using the link &quot;wss://cloudflare.domain&quot; with cloudflare.domain replaced with the link you just tunneled using cloudflare.</li>

        <div class="content">
            <p>If you can't pay for an unblocked domain you can use Ngrok as a option. Theres just some things you should know about ngrok</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ngrok is good because its tunneled, so it doesn't leak your IP Address.</li>
                <li>With the free tier you can only use the ngrok domain, which is thankfully unblocked.</li>
                <li>You can only tunnel one thing, which will be your server.</li>
                <li>After a while of using it, they will start enforcing a 1 GB a month bandwith limit.</li>
                <li>It's understandable, after all this service is 100% Free!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>ngrok guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by going to the <a href="https://ngrok.com/" class="external">ngrok website</a> and creating an account.</li>
                <li>Follow the quick setup and installation</li>
                <li>Run the command it gives you on the server computer using SSH to install ngrok</li>
                <li>Run the command to add authentication</li>
                <li>Switch to the static domain tab on the next part, and claim your static domain.</li>
                <li>Open a nano session on the file ngrok.yml in the directory &quot;~/.config/ngrok/&quot;<textarea>nano ~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml</textarea></li>
                <li>Add this to the bottom of the files
                    <pre>
endpoints:
  - name: eagserver
    url: yourNgrokDomain.ngrok-free.app
    upstream:
      url: 8081
</pre>
                    <ul><li>Replace &quot;yourNgrokDomain.ngrok-free.app&quot; with whatever domain ngrok put in the static domain box.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Install that as a systemd service<textarea>sudo ngrok service install --config ~/.config/ngrok/ngrok.yml</textarea></li>
                <li>Start the service<textarea>sudo systemctl start ngrok</textarea></li>
                <li>If you want you can also make it start whenever the server computer turns on<textarea>sudo systemctl enable ngrok</textarea></li>
                <li>Open up EaglercraftX and join the server using &quot;wss://yourNgrokDomain.ngrok-free.app&quot; but replace the yourNgrokDomain.ngrok-free.app with whatever you used before.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>IMPORTANT! Because you can't also host a client with ngrok, you will have to <a href="https://git.eaglercraft.rip/eaglercraft/eaglercraft-builds/raw/branch/main/EaglercraftX_1.8_Offline_Signed_Client.html" class="external">download a client file</a> and launch it using <a href="https://lagweird.codehs.me/file.html" class="external">lagweird.codehs.me/file.html</a></p>

        <button id="sec8Method3" type="button" class="collapsible largeButton">Method 3 Port forwarding and using Caddy</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This last method uses a little software called Caddy, which lets you serve https data to your domains. Some things to know about Caddy</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unlike the other options this is <strong>not</strong> tunneled, so if you share the domain caddy is connected to, your sorta sharing your IP</li>
                <li>Instead of using tunneling, this method requires you to port forward!</li>
                <li>That being said because it isn't tunneled it isn't reliant on any other services, aside from the domain.</li>
                <li>You can use caddy for a Server, EaglercraftX Client, dynmap, and even a website!</li>
                <li>All this requires is owning a domain of some kind that lets you make A records, so even a free subdomain from <a href="https://freedns.afraid.org/" class="external">freedns.afraid.org</a> will work.
                    <br>Making this method essentially 100% free!</li>

            <h3>Caddy guide</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Port forward port 8081 of the server computer on your router as the Internal and external port as both UDP and TCP
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's different for every router so I can't put insturctions here.</li>
                        <li>If you need an internal ip you can do this command on the server computer to find it<textarea>hostname -I</textarea></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Make an A record on your domain pointing to &quot;yourPublicIpAddress:8081&quot; with yourPublicIpAddress replaced with your public ip address
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can find your public ip address by visiting <a href="https://www.whatsmyip.org/" class="external">whatsmyip.org</a></li>
                        <li>I'm not 100% sure that this is how you do this part as I cannot test this, so if by the end of this section it works or you find a way that works, please let me know so I can include your working method.</li>

<!--im just learning about pre, i wish i knew about this before this makes things so much easier!!!-->
<pre># The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

example.com {
        # Set this path to your site's directory.
        # root * /usr/share/caddy

        # Enable the static file server.
        # file_server

        # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
        reverse_proxy localhost:8081

        # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
        # php_fastcgi localhost:9000

        <h2 id="pt3"><strong>OPTIONAL</strong> but still very suggsted Part 3: Extra things to add & know</h3>
        <p>If you've done all in the guide that lead up to this point you should have a working server, but I suggest you look at this part of the guide where I'll explain some suggsted or good things to know about your server, such as how you can host your own EaglercraftX Client.</p>
        <h3 id="pt3sec1">Section 1: I suggest adding an auth plugin to your server</h4>
        <p>If you are running an offline mode server, anyone can set their username to your username, and use your stuff! So to protect it I suggest adding a auth plugin to your server.
            <br>The authentication plugin I use is AuthMeReloaded, which is very simple to intstall onto your server.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the server computer, while connected with SSH, set your user to ser-mc
                <ul><li>If you're already in ser-mc, ignore this step</li></ul>
                <textarea>sudo su ser-mc</textarea>
            </li>
            <li>Change directory to the minecraft server plugins folder
                <textarea>cd ~/mc8/eagSurvival/plugins</textarea>
                <ul><li>If you named the minecraft server directory something else, you'll replace eagSurvival with whatever you replaced it with</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Download AuthMeReloaded legacy jar<textarea>wget https://github.com/AuthMe/AuthMeReloaded/releases/download/5.6.0/AuthMe-5.6.0-legacy.jar</textarea></li>
            <li>Restart the server, and the plugin will be there!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="pt3sec2">Section 2: Tired of having to use the command line for handling file downloads and file editng?</h4>
        <p>Don't worry! There's a simpler way! Using Secure File Transfer Protocol or SFTP for short. SFTP Allows you to upload, download, and even edit files on your server computer, and with little setup as openssh already works as a SFTP software!</p>
        <p>On windows you can access your servers SFTP server using a <a href="https://winscp.net" class="external">program called WinSCP</a>.<br> Simply download the program, run the program, set the File protocol to SFTP, set the hostname to whatever you use in the ssh command, set the username to ser-mc, and the password to whatever you set the password for ser-mc to. Hit login and you can freely edit any files ser-mc can.</p>
        <p>On linux you don't even need to download anything, in your file explorer set the directory to &quot;sftp://ser-mc@hostname&quot; with hostname replaced with whatever you use in the ssh command, and now you can edit any files ser-mc can.</p>
        <p>The directory where all your server files will be is in &quot;/home/ser-mc&quot;</p>
        <h3 id="pt3sec3">Section 3: Hosting a EaglercraftX client.</h3>
        <p>This section will guide you on hosting an EaglercraftX client on your server computer for you and your players to use on chromebooks so they can join your server.
            <br>If you used ngrok you cannot do this part. You need to install nginx for this method, if you don't already have nginx installed just run this command to install it<textarea>sudo apt install nginx</textarea>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the server computer connected with SSH Set your user to root
                <textarea>sudo su root</textarea>
                <ul><li>To run sudo commands you need to be in the main account, if you are currently in the ser-mc account do &quot;CTRL+A+D&quot; to detach from it.</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Change directory to &quot;/var/www/html&quot; <textarea>cd /var/www/html</textarea></li>
            <li>Download the latest eaglercraftX web build <textarea>wget https://git.eaglercraft.rip/eaglercraft/eaglercraft-builds/raw/branch/main/EaglercraftX_1.8_Web.zip</textarea></li>
            <li>Install unzip<textarea>apt install unzip</textarea></li>
            <li>Unzip the downloaded zip file<textarea>unzip EaglercraftX_1.8_Web.zip</textarea></li>
            <li>Remove the zip file<textarea>rm ./EaglercraftX_1.8_Web.zip</textarea></li>
            <li>Let other people access this website using your preferred method
                <ul>
                    <li>If you used cloudflare tunneling, create a new public hostname, with the Type set to &quot;HTTP&quot;, the URL set to &quot;localhost:80&quot;, and something to differ from the previous hostname you made.</li>
                    <li>If you used caddy
                        <ol>
                            <li>Port forward port 80 of the server computer on your router as the Internal and external port as both UDP and TCP</li>
                            <li>Make an A record on your domain pointing to &quot;yourPublicIpAddress:80&quot; with yourPublicIpAddress replaced with your public ip address</li>
                            <li>In the caddyfile add a new section with this in it, replace &quot;example.com&quot; with a new domain <strong>IT CANNOT BE THE SAME DOMAIN YOU USED BEFORE</strong>
                                <pre>
example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:80
}
</pre>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Go to the domain and enjoy the client.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cool thing to note! The &quot;/var/www/html/&quot; directory is everything in your new website. If you wanted you can change the index.html there to your own website, and have it link to the client index.html one way or another. Just tinker around with it if you're interested.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Congratulations, you've setup a working server</h2> 
        <p>it wasnt so hard now was it? now you can enjoy it.</p>
