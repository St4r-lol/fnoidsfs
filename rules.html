    <div class="content">
        <p>If you want something from a nation that is not on this list, ask me and I will add it.</p>

    <p>An example of this: If a Nation called &quot;RED&quot; won a <span class="red">level 2 war</span> against &quot;BLU&quot;, they would be awarded <span class="points">100 war points</span> to be used on the nation BLU. 
        <br>1 day after the war the nation RED decides that the nation BLU will have to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Give nation RED 10% of their core land &lpar;Uses 20 points&rpar;</li>
        <li>Can only trade with RED for 6 days &lpar;Uses 10 points&rpar;</li>
        <li>Give nation RED 2 colonies &lpar;Uses 40 points&rpar;</li>
        <li>Owes nation RED these items
            <ul>
                <li>1 stack of Oak logs &lpar;64&div;5.12=12.5 points&rpar;</li>
                <li>32 Potatoes &lpar;32&div;5.12=6.25 points&rpar;</li>
                <li>1 Iron ingot &lpar;1&div;1.28=0.78125, we'll just round it to 0.78, so RED uses 0.78 points</li>
                <li>6 Diamonds &lpar;6&div;0.64=9.375, so RED uses 9.38 points.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All that costs 98.91 points, which is under the 100 points they were given, so that post war action is accepted and the remaining 1.09 points that nation RED didn't use gets discarded, and cannot be saved for a future war.</p>
